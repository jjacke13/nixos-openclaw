# nixos-openclaw
NixOS Openclaw package and modules

## Goal
- Create ready to run out-of-the-box nixos configurations that have openclaw already installed, configured and can be used from non-technical users

## Current State
- openclaw package (including web UI) working
- memory local embeddings working out of the box when running the package manually
- default nixos module currently under testing

## Next steps
- More openclaw dependencies will be added, needed for skill installation etc.
- More options will be added to the nixos module
- NixOS configurations will be added for small devices (Rpi4, Rpi5, Nanopi). Openclaw is pretty lightweight and can run easily on them
